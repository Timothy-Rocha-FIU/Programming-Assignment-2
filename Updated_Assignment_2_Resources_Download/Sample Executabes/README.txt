To assist you in understanding the instructor's implementation for Assignment 2, sample executable files for the client and server have been provided.

- You must start the server first, followed by any number of clients.

- You can create multiple clients by duplicating the provided client application and assigning distinct names, such as client1, client2, etc.

- The server and clients should run in separate terminals.

- Your client/server implementation must adhere to the structure and functionality of the instructorâ€™s sample client/server applications including the message formats exchanged between Clients and Server.

- It is essential to experiment with the instructor-provided client/server sample applications to thoroughly understand the assignment requirements and gain insights for starting your implementation.
